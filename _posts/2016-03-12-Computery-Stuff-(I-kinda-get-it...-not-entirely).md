Hello

Below are examples of some peripherals:

Input: Camera		Scanner	Microphone		Keyboard/Mouse/Touchscreen

Output: Monitor	Printer		Speakers		Monitor

What: Vision		Printed Documents	Sound		Vision

Memory:

Memory is a short term way of the computer knowing what you are doing, when you switch the computer off, the memory is wiped. The memory hardware is called RAM (Random Access Memory)

Storage:

Storage is a long term way of the computer knowing what you are doing, when you switch the computer off the storage stays there. The storage hardware is called a hard drive. It is covered in tiny square that are either of or on, so the hard drive is coded in binary (e.g. 100111010101011111000)

Processor:

The Processor is called a CPU. It controls the speed that the computer can process files and programs.

Malware:

The word malware is a combination of the malicious and software.  They attack most digital devices, examples of malware are viruses, worms, botnets and trojans. They crash, slow down or reboot the infected devices.

Viruses:

A virus is a small program that makes more of itself to spread through the infected device's files. They attach themselves to a program in the device. It may just slow down your device or it may delete documents and applications. Once inside a device it easily spreads, like a viral disease in an animal.

Worms:

Worms are a piece of malware that can spread from device to device easily. They do not attach themselves to programs, though they can copy themselves quickly, so they can harm the device quickly. It can hack into an email accounts and then send a copy of itself to all contacts on that device.

Trojans:

Trojans are pieces of malware that pretend to be a safe and secure program, but actually attack your device, they may be used to capture passwords, take control of computers whilst online and take screenshots and send them to an outside computer, hoping to find personal or financial information.

Botnet:

Botnet operates by taking over a group of computers, usually from another botnet virus, and spreading spam or virus to more computers via the Internet.
