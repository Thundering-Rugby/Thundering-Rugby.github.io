A computer consists of memory and a CPU. The CPU has many parts. The Arithmetic Logic Unit runs add, divide, minus, multiply, greater than, less than, equals, Booleans (True/False), AND, OR, NOT. The Control Unit decides what the computer is going to do. The AC is the accumulator, that holds pieces of processed data. 

Registers:

PC - Program Counter 

MAR - Memory Address Register

MDR - Memory Data Register

CIR - Central Instruction Register

Von Neumann Architecture

CPU - Central Processing Unit - Handles instructions within the computer.

RAM - Random Access Memory - Stores information, non-permanently, so when a computer is running it can store information that need ro be used very quickly. When a computer is loaded up, things are being loaded from storage to RAM. It is a form of volatile memory.

ROM - Read-Only Memory - Memory Sticks, CDs etc. The BIOS is stored on ROM.

Motherboard -  Holds together crucial components.

PCI Expansion - Connecting apparatus for a 32bit bus,

North Bridge - Communicates directly with CPU, controls interactions with memory, PCI, caches, and  AGP, handles more complicated data etc.

South Bridge - Control I/O functions, like USB, audio, serial, BIOS and ISA bus. All functions of processor, except memory PCI and AGP.

BIOS - Basic Input/Output System - Controls setup processes.

Storage - Stores operations and data while a program is being executed. 

Bus - Path that carry data to the CPU and Computer.

Peripherals - Keyboard, Mouse, Monitors, External Memory, Headsets, Printers etc.

SATA - Serial ATA - Allows storage mirroring. 

**STANDARD - Hardware Based,  USB, HDMI etc. Physical Objects. **

**PROTOCOL - **
