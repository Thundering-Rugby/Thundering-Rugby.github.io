This there was no real main task. Mr Keen, put a list of necessary extra sheets that you would find on a company's spreadsheet, such as profits and losses and order lists. I connected these together to make a sheet where it would calculate whether the company was making money. This involved a new function using if statements and the < and > signs. I also fixed the vlookup elements of the spreadsheet, so it didnâ€™t frazzle itself. Yay! Below is a version to you to try out.
