  <tr>
    <td>I learnt in a number of ways, mainly sitting down and thinking why it could be wrong/broken, then trying multiple ways to fix things. This method was most effective.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I sometimes did not generate enough useful ideas. Also i had a slight lack of knowledge of how some of it worked so when it did break it took longer than it should have to fix it.</td>

    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>

  <tr>
    <td>I will use my widened knowledge of It and computers to think it through more. Also I shall try different strategies more to see if that improves it.</td>
