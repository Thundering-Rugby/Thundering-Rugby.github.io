Today was the first week back in Y9. We were introduced to Google Sheets and began with some simple functions, such as =sum and =average.  I found this very easy as it was very easy to understand and obvious if it failed, which thankfully it didn't. For homework we began to make a fully functioning order form. We started to create a stocklist and a function where when you entered the code of the product it will bring up the name and price, and when you entered the quantity you could see the total cost. This worked with the vlookup function. This took a bit of thinking but was entirely logical.
