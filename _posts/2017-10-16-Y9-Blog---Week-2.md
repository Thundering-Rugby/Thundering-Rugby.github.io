Today we continued on with our order form and began to develop it further to make it similar to a online shop, like Amazon. We started by ensuring that our functions still work and hadn't been frazzled by the vlookup, which mine hadn’t. We then began to look at discount codes. This was slightly more complicated than before, as it contained more functions than before. We started by ensuring that the discount code’s ID was valid by using the left and an then used an if function to check the % discount necessary to that individual code. This went well and I still had a fully functioning order form. For homework we had to create some variable delivery bands so that the more expensive the order the more delivery it charges.
