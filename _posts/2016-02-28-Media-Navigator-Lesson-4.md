Hello!

I found it easy to create my identity map, and I felt confident about sharing it with the class. It felt rather daunting to comment on the identity maps, as I didn't want to upset anyone. My comments were helpful and easy to use to make progress with. I prefer this method as it is anonymous so you don’t feel under pressure, as you are not face to face, so you will not get an answer or retaliation. It is different as you know the people commenting though you don’t know exactly who it is as it is anonymous. Making the identity map showed me not to post personal information online, though I don’t do that so I don’t want to changev anything. These lessons changed my view on social media, as I now know the up and downsides to it. I am now going to use social media to interact with people safely on projects, or just as friends in REAL LIFE!.

That's all Folks,

Bye!
