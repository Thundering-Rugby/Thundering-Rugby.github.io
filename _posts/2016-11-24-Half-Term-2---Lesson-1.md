    <td>My partner is still not here, but I had a new human bean to explain the fuze mechanics to. The most effective way of teaching him the functions of the different lines of code, then letting him loose typing the code.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I need to work on slowing down the explanation and rushing over certain details. This will improve my learning as I get to test my understanding of the code.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Read the code before explaining thus understanding the code before and being able to deliver a full explanation</td>
