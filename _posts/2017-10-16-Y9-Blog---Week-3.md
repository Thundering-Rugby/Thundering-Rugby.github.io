In today's lesson we created a format where when you leave a cell blank it doesn't go mental. This took the majority of the lesson as we were left to our own devices (Ha,ha,ha) and give the necessary code functions that we needed to attack the problem. Thi required some logical thinking and this needed a longer time than usual to sort this out. This problem was quite challenging but I sorted it out in the end. We then went on to a foolproof discount system that involved similar functions to the item codes.  This was set as homework and I spent 35 minutes on the challenge but couldnâ€™t get it to work so I had to go back to a simpler but functioning variant.
